/*
    In the C and C++ programming languages, " #pragma once " is a non-standard
 but widely supported preprocessor directive designed
 to cause the current source file to be included ONLY ONCE IN A SINGLE COMPILATION.
    " #pragma once " has several advantages, including:
 less code, avoidance of name clashes, and sometimes improvement in compilation speed.
 
 *** In this case, because of the #pragma once preprocessor directive (it works for Visual Studio),
 *** Vehicle.h file will compile just for once.
